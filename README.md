Semester assignment for the course "Introduction to Quantitative Finance and Financial Risk" for my masters degree.



Triangular and One-way Arbitrage
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Goals of the assignment ###

Consider the attached Quotation Matrix. 
After downloading it, you will open it, and then save it locally on your computer. 
This way you will all have different tables.

Write a Python program that explores all possibilities of triangular arbitrage, produces the corresponding trades,
and records the overall result in the chosen by the user currency.

Write a second program that explores all possibilities of one-way-arbitrage, after receiving intended currency trade from the user (e.g., I want to sell USD and buy GBP). 
The program must produce the corresponding trades.

###Files###

1)The file "Quotation Matrix.xlsx" contains all necessary information for the exchange rates.

2)The files "One Way Arbitrage.ipynb" and "Triangular Arbitrage.ipynb" have the python code for the one-way and triangular trades respectively.

3)The file "Report.pdf" have theoretical explainations about one-way arbitrage and triangular arbitrage and further explainations about the method used for the coding solutions.
