# Python-Arbitrage-AUEB
Semester assignment for the course "Introduction to Quantitative Finance and Financial Risk" for my masters degree.

Triangular and One-way Arbitrage
Goals of the assignment 

Consider the attached Quotation Matrix. 
After downloading it, you will open it, and then save it locally on your computer. 
This way you will all have different tables.

Write a Python program that explores all possibilities of triangular arbitrage, produces the corresponding trades,
and records the overall result in the chosen by the user currency.

Write a second program that explores all possibilities of one-way-arbitrage, after receiving intended currency trade from the user (e.g., I want to sell USD and buy GBP). 
The program must produce the corresponding trades.


The file "Quotation Matrix.xlsx" contains all necessary information for the exchange rates.
The files "One Way Arbitrage.ipynb" and "Triangular Arbitrage.ipynb" have the python code for the one-way and triangular trades respectively
The file "Report.pdf" have theoretical explainations about one-way arbitrage and triangular arbitrage and further explainations about the method used for the coding solutions.
